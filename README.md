# Group Project- ATM

## Lets finish this project step by step with timeline

First I want write everything in word file which is explanation or details of the diagram.

Cant we draw UML Diagram using Visual_Paradigm?

1. System analysis: study, understand, and define requirements for the system (model of the system's functional requirements) 
2. Defining the boundaries of the problem 
3. Use-case model 
4. Deployment view 
5. Sequence diagram and operation
6. Design to code (UML design diagram)

This is our final group project of Object Oriented Programming and Analysis subject. Our project is to build a bank ATM software system. In this document we will try to explain the requirements and functionality of the ATM system. In another word, we will analyse the system and try to make you to understand how we build the system and how it works for banks. It is obvious that ATM is part of bank so we will show the whole picture of Banking system but we will only focus on ATM system. Ofcause bank can operate without ATM but ATM is positive impact on bank and their income. Also, ATM will make easy for customers to make money transections. 

## Introduction
Under indroduction we will explain the following areas. 
- Main Purpose of the project.
- Scope of the project
- Overview of whole system
- Definition of some of the important words we used in this documents and the system.

## 1.1 Purpose
This document mainly decribes the software requriements and functionality of the ATM machine. And we will build the software system for ATM. It is intended for the designer developer and maintainer of the ATM. Also if any bank which dont have ATM services we might be able to sell the software or work for them to build a ATM system.
